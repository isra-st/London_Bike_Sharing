# London Bicycles Sharing
The goals of this project are:
1. Perform an Explorartory Data Analysis with visualization and 
2. Use a liner regression model (OLS) to predict the number of bikes rented.

# Tools Used
* Pandas
* Numpy
* Matplotlib
* Seaborn
* Time
* scikit-learn
* statsmodels
* Trello 
* MIRO

# OLS regression model Performance

Train R^2: 0.628
Train Adjusted R^2: 0.628

Test R^2: 0.655
Test R^2: 0.582

Difference in R^2 between train and test 2.07%
Difference in R^2 between train and test is 4.6% which is less than 5%.

# Process
1. Design: 
  * I have created a MIRO board with the story mapping. https://miro.com/app/board/o9J_lRe3F5E=/
  * I have created a Trello board with the epics of requirements needed to deliver. https://trello.com/b/S7aR17IA 
2. Clean, manipulate and create the visualizations. 
  * Exploratory Data Analysis
  * Create visualizations
  * Create Dummies
  * Recursive Feature Selection (RFE)
3. Create the linear regression model. 
  * Validate the assumptions (Linearity, Autocorrelation, Sub-Normality, Normality, Multicollinearity)
4. Analyze the model perforamnce
5. Creating a Story Telling presentation
